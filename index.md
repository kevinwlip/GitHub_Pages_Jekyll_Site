I created this simple site using GitHub Pages and Jekyll.

Will post projects and past work that I have worked on below:

- [Automation with Pytest and Selenium](https://github.com/kevinwlip/Automation.git)

- [GitHub Pages with Jekyll](https://github.com/kevinwlip/GitHub_Pages_Jekyll_Site.git)

Followed this as a guide [simple_site](https://kbroman.org/simple_site)

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) provide a simple way to make a
website using
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and
[git](https://git-scm.com).

The sites use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a
[ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) [gem](https://rubygems.org/), to
convert Markdown files to html, and this part is done
automatically when you push the materials to the `gh-pages` branch
of a GitHub repository.
